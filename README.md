# Kalman-Filter-Based-GPS-Signal-Tracking
Noisy GPS signal filtering algorithm with Kalman Filter

Using standard Kalman Filter to filter the noisy GPS signal in Longitude and Latitude.

From the result below:

The dots are the noisy data; dasheh line is the groundtruth; purple solid line is the filtered result.

You can see the noised GPS is smoothed thanks to the Kalman filter.

All the codes are written from scratch in C++.
